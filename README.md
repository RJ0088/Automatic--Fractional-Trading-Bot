To use the application, initially run the application and you should recieve an error stating "no user authentication file found".
The application will then create a default xml file called "UserAuthentication.xml" (DO NOT SHARE) onto your desktop.

# How to use the "UserAuthentication.xml" file:
* open the file
* Decide whether you would like to use the "Test" Servers (recommended) and or the live marketplace servers.
* Fill in the appropriate attribute values with your secure API keys either from the Binance Test server or Marketplace.
